# Computing Environments and Code Editors

## Computing Environments
Many professional web programmers develop code on your own laptop or desktop. 
Regardless of which operating system you use, you can be successful. 
Some examples are listed below.

- Apple
 - Mac OS makes it easy to use the terminal and command line tools that are similar to Linux. You may want to install 
[iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) and use this in place of the default terminal.
- Windows
 - Use [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) as your terminal environment. 
 This will provide you a functional terminal that works like Linux, with integration for Git as well. 
 I do not recommend using the Linux Subsystem for Windows. This has regularly caused problems for students in the class.
- Linux
 - If you use Linux as your main OS, you will have everything you need. You can use the department open labs. 
You can also install a Linux VM on your Mac or Windows machine. 
You can get VMWare Player or VirtualBox for free and install Linux for free as well. 
Read this guide to [choosing VM software](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/best-virtual-machine-apps-for-mac-linux-and-windows-pcs/). 
Read this guide to [installing Linux in VirtualBox](https://www.lifewire.com/install-ubuntu-linux-windows-10-steps-2202108) 
or this guide to [installing Linux in VmWare](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-linux-windows-vmware-virtual-machine/). 
This is a good option for becoming more familiar with Linux, which is a very useful skill for administering remote machines. 
If you choose this option, you will want to be sure to have enough CPU power and RAM to handle the VM. 
This is not recommended for older machines.

## Code Editors
For a coding environment, I strongly recommend you do not use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). 
Rather, you want to use a code editor that provides some features like syntax highlighting and linting. 
You will then use command-line tools to bundle your code, test your code, work with git, and deploy your code on a remote server. 
Some good choices, roughly in order of preference, include:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
- Vim(https://vim.sourceforge.io/download.php)
- Emacs(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html)
All of these are available on each main operating system. 
All are also free, although Sublime asks you to buy a license for continued use.
